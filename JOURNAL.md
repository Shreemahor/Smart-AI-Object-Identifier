# Making a CAD for the Camera first

## Research

I know I need a Raspberry Pi, Picamera, and some software. My biggest problem is that my Picamera is in a cardboard box and needs to be upgraded, so I plan to 3d print a new case for it.

## CAD

Right now it is in a loose cardboard case and that must be fixed. I am going to be using ***FreeCAD*** for making CAD designs.

I have just started making a hole for the front side of the camera, but it seems that its structure is *far more complex* than what I first thought. I am going to upskill in FreeCAD and finish the CAD for the camera.
