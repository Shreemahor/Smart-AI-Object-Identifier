## 10/7/2025 4 PM - Firstly, started making CAD

# Making a CAD for the Camera first

## Research

I know I need a Raspberry Pi, Picamera, and some software. My biggest problem is that my Picamera is in a cardboard box and needs to be upgraded, so I plan to 3d print a new case for it.

## CAD

Right now it is in a loose cardboard case and that must be fixed. I am going to be using ***FreeCAD*** for making CAD designs.

I have just started making a hole for the front side of the camera, but it seems that its structure is *far more complex* than what I first thought. I am going to upskill in FreeCAD and finish the CAD for the camera.  

## 10/7/2025 8 PM - Finished Camera's Case CAD

# Progress

## Learning

I needed to learn lots of new parts of *FreeCAD* like:
	- Chamfers
	- fillets
	- thick solids
Many function created hassles by giving errors. I needed to go back and read how to use them and correct these errors.

## Parts of Camera

### Front

Has chamfered hole for camera lens and holes for *screws* and *bosses* (but these are not finalized). Front facing part of camera, measured to accuracy.

### Main body

Has a coin-like slot for the camera cable. Very box-like because its a thick solid.

### Future

***Securing Mechanism*** must be fixed. Its unclear if the screws, bolts, and bosses will work with the model.  

## 10/8/2025 - Finalized Design & Fastening  

![final_camera.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTg1LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f24f2e6c86287f132162d38bdb687d95ccf77b63/final_camera.png)

# Finalized Design

## Issue

There were screw bosses that I put on and didn't know much about. Now I know that it is supposed to help screws but I put it on wrong. I also put the radius of the holes wrong because I didn't know what I was going to do. I spent a long time trying different things to fix it but nothing worked

## Research

I measured my camera more and compared options. I measured things like the radius of the lense, border, and center more carefully. I evaluated which fastening method to use I considered connectors, coppers, and self-tapping screws, but I decided on ***M2*10 Philips Screw*** and ***M2 Nuts*** on the ends to secure.

## Fix

I needed to change the size of holes (except the ribbon cable channel). I removed the bosses and realized that this is enough.
