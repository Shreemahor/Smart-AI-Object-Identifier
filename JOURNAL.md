# Making a CAD for the Camera first

## Research

I know I need a Raspberry Pi, Picamera, and some software. My biggest problem is that my Picamera is in a cardboard box and needs to be upgraded, so I plan to 3d print a new case for it.

## CAD

Right now it is in a loose cardboard case and that must be fixed. I am going to be using ***FreeCAD*** for making CAD designs.

I have just started making a hole for the front side of the camera, but it seems that its structure is *far more complex* than what I first thought. I am going to upskill in FreeCAD and finish the CAD for the camera.  

## 10/7/2025 8 PM - Finished Camera's Case CAD

# Progress

## Learning

I needed to learn lots of new parts of *FreeCAD* like:
	- Chamfers
	- fillets
	- thick solids
Many function created hassles by giving errors. I needed to go back and read how to use them and correct these errors.

## Parts of Camera

### Front

Has chamfered hole for camera lens and holes for *screws* and *bosses* (but these are not finalized). Front facing part of camera, measured to accuracy.

### Main body

Has a coin-like slot for the camera cable. Very box-like because its a thick solid.

### Future

***Securing Mechanism*** must be fixed. Its unclear if the screws, bolts, and bosses will work with the model.
