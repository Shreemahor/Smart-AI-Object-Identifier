\# Challenges Faced



There were many issues with this old model.

&nbsp;	- It had mounting holes of 2.2mm diameter but then I decided upon 1.8

&nbsp;	- Its measurements were slightly off especially at the edges

&nbsp;	- There were unnecessary screw bosses



When I tried fixing these, many previous parts of my model crashed and I was unable to progress.



\# Fix



This is the transition between my second and third journal entry. I took measurements again and started fresh, taking the old model of inspiration.
